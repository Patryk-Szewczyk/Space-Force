                    Space Force Game is a simple 2D shooter that involves controlling a spaceship, destroying 
                    enemies attacking the player. The game contains 5 levels, the last of which is a boss fight.

                    At the beginning, we create a player and move on. We see the level page. We choose the only 
                    one available, the first one. The game begins. The arrows buttons are responsible for controlling 
                    the spaceship. At the top left, you can see the armor (red) and the rate of fire bar (blue). 
                    At the top in the middle, there is a point counter for the level. At the top right, there is 
                    the number of stars earned in the level. The player wins the level when he destroys all enemies, 
                    and loses when he is destroyed. The player is destroyed when he loses all armor by colliding 
                    with enemy missiles or directly with them. After the game ends, the player moves to the levels 
                    page. There, he can enter the ship upgrade page, where he can upgrade his spaceship for the 
                    stars earned - armor and damage.
